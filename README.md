# Suicides and Happinesss Data Analysis

Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Cufflinks

Using visualization tools like seaborn and plotly libraries to answer important questions about the number of suicides all over the world in the period 1985-2016. The data I am using is from Kaggle called "Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016: Compares socio-economic info with suicide rates by year and country".

I have used matplotlib in past but I am fairly new to seaborn. A notebook in kaggle was very helpful in increasing my familiarity with it. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/rblcoder/mental-health-happiness-economics-human-freedom

In addition to seaborn I have used plotly which is more interactive library. Link: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-next-level-of-data-visualization-in-python-dd6e99039d5e

Initially, I have planned to use just one dataset(the suicides one) but later I have decided to add one happiness datset from the year 2015 as well because the word suicide all over the notebook was very somber. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness

Summary of results of the analysis:
* Country with highest number of suicides Russian Federation, United States and Japan.

* GDP per capita might or might not have inverse effect on suicides number, we will see that later. But from these two graphs there is slight hint that there can be.

* Russian Federation has highest number of suicides between the age range of 35-54 years. It is not that surprising since country also registers levels of depression above the regional levels.

* There is a big gap between female and male suicides rate. Female suicide rate is less as compared to Male.

* Between 2011 and 2015 highest number of suicides are constantly in United States followed by Russian Federation which has highest number overall from 1985.

* Happiness Score seems to be directly correlated with GDP per capita.
